# MNIST-K-Means-Clustering

### PREFERRED ENVIRONMENT --> JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

K-means is algorithm very useful for finding clusters of items with measurable quality. This quality is an n-dimensional vector.
K-means in 2D comes most naturally as itâ€™s basically areas defined by dots with similar coordinates. 1D is therefore line segments defined by dots with similar coordinate and in 3D it would be volumes.The accuracy of clustering MNIST or any data set depends on what kind of features you extract.
